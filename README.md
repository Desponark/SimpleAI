## Simple AI

The goal is to combine steering behaviours with a simple finite state machine in order to to serve as a practical exercise for myself and explore how they work and how they can be used to create a believable AI behaviour system for an Action-RPG that focuses on small encounters and third person action combat (imagine Outward, a Souls game or something of that nature).  
I especially wanted to focus on steering and behaviour and not on locomotion or combat because the intention is to use this as a foundation on which a custom locomotion system can be planted, which handles the “how” of movement, while steering and behaviour tells it “where” and “why”.

## Engine / Language

- Godot 4.1 Mono / C#

## Background Info

## Showcase

## Basic Framework

### Steering Behaviour

Action Selection  
Steering  
Locomotion  

### Finite-State Machine

State design pattern  
encapsulating state-specific behaviour, and the transitions, into different states
